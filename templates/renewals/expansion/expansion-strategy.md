# Expansion Strategy Framework

## Expansion Paths
- Land new team (adjacent department)
- Add new use case (same team)
- Upgrade tier (more seats / features)
- Add-on module

## Expansion Signals
- Usage saturation (hitting limits)
- New initiative tied to your product
- Exec asks “what else can you do?”
- Cross-functional requests
- Strong champion + internal storytelling

## Discovery Prompts
- “What’s changing in the business this quarter?”
- “What teams touch this workflow next?”
- “What breaks if this stays the same?”
- “If we could wave a wand, what would you add?”
- “Who else cares about this outcome?”

## Expansion Plan
- Stakeholders + decision makers
- Value hypothesis + metric target
- Pilot scope + success criteria
- Timeline + procurement path
